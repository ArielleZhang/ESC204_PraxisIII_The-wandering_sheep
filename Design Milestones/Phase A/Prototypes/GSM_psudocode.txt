Followers:
    stores unique sheep id
    while leader message:
        send sheep id to Node

Node:
    broadcast leader message to followers
    calculate signal stength for every received sheep id
    if signal strength > signal strength threshold:
            store the sheep id into sheep cluster ids
    if update:
        send GPS location and sheep cluser ids to backend via GSM

Backend:
    store all updates
    if received a new update:
        for every node:
                if no cluster ids: report this missing leader sheep;s id and its GPS location
                for every id in the previous updated cluster ids:
                    if not in the current updated cluster id:
                        check all the other current updated cluster ids
                        if not found:
                            report missing follower's sheep id and GPS location of the previous cluster
